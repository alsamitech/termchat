# Alsami - Terminal Chat
*a low level, high functioning chat server. Written in C*

This is a (open source), ported version of alschat that runs with a low level socket and does not use QT webserver implmentations.
This is one of the lightest web servers. However, keep in mind that this does not use encryption of ANY sort, so take this instead as a way just a project that you have for the sake of it. However, an encryption library will be implemented ASAP. ]
